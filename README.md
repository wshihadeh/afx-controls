# afx-controls

A lightweight collection of reusable **JavaFX** UI controls and helpers for desktop applications.  
The project is designed to simplify building modern JavaFX UIs by offering composable controls, sensible defaults, and CSS theming support.

> **Status:** Early development. APIs may change until v1.0.

## ✨ Features
- Custom JavaFX `Control` and `Skin` implementations
- Utility classes for layout, styling, and interaction
- CSS-based theming
- Example usage and demos (coming soon)

## 🧪 CI / CD

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for build, test, and release.

### What runs
- **Build & Test** (`ci.yml`)
  - Runs on every push and pull request
  - Validates build against JDK 17 and 21
  - Uploads test reports when failures occur

- **Release & Publish** (`release.yml`)
  - Runs when pushing a tag like `v0.1.0`
  - Publishes artifacts to Maven Central (configurable)
  - Creates a GitHub Release with autogenerated notes

### Required secrets
Configure these in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- `OSSRH_USERNAME` — Sonatype (Maven Central) username  
- `OSSRH_PASSWORD` — Sonatype (Maven Central) password  
- `SIGNING_KEY` — ASCII-armored or base64 GPG private key  
- `SIGNING_PASSWORD` — passphrase for signing key  
- `GH_TOKEN` — (optional) GitHub token for releases (default `GITHUB_TOKEN` usually works)
